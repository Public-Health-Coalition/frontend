We're planning to have virtual events 3 nights per week right now (game nights on Thursdays, venting sessions on Sundays, and topic discussions on Tuesdays, all at 8PM EST). We're also open to anyone hosting any other events they'd like to host through our organization if they have other ideas and want to lead some virtual events at other times. We also have our email/DMs open for anyone that would like to chat via messenger or we'll have one of our student volunteers call/video chat anyone that wants to talk to someone. We're here for any emotional support that anyone anywhere needs right now.
