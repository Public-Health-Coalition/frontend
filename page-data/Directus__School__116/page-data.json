Neither teachers nor the kids were ready for this drastic change, and they have voiced their need for help. Let's get together and use our smart brains that got us into grad school to help these kids out. The current plan is to use Zoom/Facetime/Google Chat or any other online medium that is convenient for the kids and the tutors to help with homework or keep them occupied while the parents need some time on their own. <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1jZ1hqCiz7qG_OMIZjmM88QbZauhd0DvhL-ZIVw4nWdc/viewform?ts=5e7b8ad3&edit_requested=true\">Sign up here today!</a></p>","directusId":491,"status":"published","created_on":"2020-03-23 13:04:38","id":"Directus__ActivityInfo__491"},{"activity":{"status":"published","name":"Arts, Media, and Entertainment","directusId":4,"created_on":"2020-03-24 22:54:05","id":"Directus__Activity__4"},"contact":"<p>NODA Team (<a href=\"mailto:noda@jefferson.edu\">noda@jefferson.edu</a>)</p>","details":"<p>Clips of Compassion - No One Dies Alone (NODA), a Jefferson University student-led hospital volunteer group, has been looking for ways to engage with Jefferson Hospital patients during these challenging times. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, we have suspended our bedside compassionate care volunteering with patients who would otherwise be dying alone. Currently, Jefferson hospital patients are only allowed 1 visitor due to the restrictions. Inspired by our mission, we quickly developed an innovative way to stay connected and make a positive impact called the \"Clips of Compassion\" Project spearheaded by the members of NODA. We are compiling audio and video clips of singing, reading poetry, positive messages, dance performances, etc. from any and all Jefferson students that would like to contribute. Our goal is to use the already accessible hospital iPads to play our compiled \"Clips of Compassion\" to all patients who are isolated under COVID-19 precautions. We hope to bring inspiration and joy to these patients, letting them know that we all care.</p>\n\n<p>We have created a <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18t4OXfa3PHDn77R731cBgpsYdChusTFe?usp=sharing\">Google Drive link</a> that anyone with a Jefferson email address can access and add their contributions to.</p>\n\n<p>We hope that you consider creating this positive message with us and we look forward to hearing from you!</p>","directusId":492,"status":"published","created_on":"2020-03-23 13:04:38","id":"Directus__ActivityInfo__492"},{"activity":{"status":"published","name":"Childcare","directusId":6,"created_on":"2020-03-24 22:54:05","id":"Directus__Activity__6"},"contact":"<p>JeffSitters Team (<a href=\"mailto:jeffsitters@gmail.com\">jeffsitters@gmail.com</a>)</p>","details":"<p>JeffSitters Babysitting Services - Many Jefferson students are currently away from their clinical obligations and eager to help front-line healthcare staff during this time of crisis.

We are collecting donations from individuals and organizations of video-enabled smart devices (smartphones, tablets, laptops) to help vulnerable populations (seniors, low-income, etc.) stay connected with loved ones and the world. We need volunteers to solicit donations, specifically we need help developing creative approaches to encourage donations from individuals, as well as those with good people skills to reach out to companies and Universities to solicit bulk donations. In addition, there are opportunities to connect with local hospitals and nursing homes to determine their device need and develop device accepting workflows. If you are tech savvy we could use your help loading donated devices with apps for nursing homes who cannot do this themselves. There are MANY different ways to get involved so if you are interested please do not hesitate to reach out! All of these efforts will help get devices into the hands of patients and elderly individuals.
