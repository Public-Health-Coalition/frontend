While efforts to increase production of N95s and surgical masks are underway, we have all seen the photos and read the stories of healthcare professionals being issued one masks and having to rewear it day after day. There are efforts going on across the country to sew cloth masks for HCPs to be worn over their surgical masks and/or N95s to try to extend the life of them. Just a note, currently there is a shortage of elastic, but that is okay! Ribbon or fabric ties are preferred by many hospitals because they can be washed/sanitized easier and the ties have a longer \"life\" than elastic! MUSM students can donate completed masks at school in donation box in the atrium near the tutor hallway.

The Medical Association of Georgia Medical Reserve Corps (MAG MRC) is encouraging physicians and allied health care professionals - including retired physicians, PAs, APRNs, nurses, dentists, pharmacists, medical students, and fourth-year pharmacy students - to volunteer for its COVID-19 Response Team. The MAG MRC COVID-19 Response Team is expected to be used in an array of ways in the coming weeks. Most of these volunteers are expected to serve in their area, whether that's working at a health care facility or using a telehealth option, but it is possible that some will be asked to travel to other parts of the state if the virus overwhelms a community's health care capacity. Note that there are telemedicine-only and local clinics-only options.</p>\n<p>MAG MRC COVID-19 Response Team candidates must:</p>\n<p>1.
