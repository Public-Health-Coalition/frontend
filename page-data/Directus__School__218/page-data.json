Chicago COVIDsitters supports healthcare workers and other essential workers in the Chicagoland area and surrounding suburbs by offering free childcare, pet sitting, and household errands. Our goal is to recruit volunteers to provide free services to those who need us most. If a healthcare worker is interested, we will match a local health professional student to the healthcare worker to address their specific request and need.
